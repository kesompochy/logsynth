The provided logs contain multiple requests blocked by the OWASP CRS rule "owasp-crs-v030001-id930130-lfi." Here is the evaluation:

1. All requests targeting `.env` files are from a remote IP in Canada ("regionCode: CA") or Great Britain ("regionCode: GB").
2. These requests are accessing potentially sensitive files (like `.env`) which is usually indicative of malicious activity.

Given the nature of the requests and the originating regions, these blocks do not appear to be false positives.

However, one request (towards `/upload`) was made from a Japanese IP and was flagged by the SQLi rule:

- This specific case meets the criteria of being from Japan and might be legitimate business activity, which warrants further review to determine if it was a false positive.

All other requests do not require action.
